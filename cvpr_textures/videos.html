	"0": "NCAs trained on different patterns being evaluated for a number of steps, having their states damaged, and recovering from such damage. Videos correspond to figure on opening page.",
	"4": "Bubbles are initially generated by the NCA as several small seeds of bubbles. Some of these grow to be larger bubbles,and some implode. Eventually, a bubble-density similar to the template image is achieved. The NCA exhibits behaviour wherebubbles appear to behave almost like solid structures, despite being a visual product of a homogeneous computation on a grid which does not differentiate between background and bubble.",
	"6": "First, candidate black and white diamonds are generated. These are then iteratively merged or destroyed until perfect consistency is achieved.",
	"7": "The walls of this maze-like texture are treated as solids. They migrate and join other walls to form the texture, incorporating some of the path-morphology of the original walls.",
	"8": "The NCA starts by forming multiple potential bluestripes, which subsequently merge with one other until total consistency is reached.",
	"9": "8x zoomed view of NCA exhibiting algorithmic behaviour over time - rearranging strokes to achieve perfect consistency in the lattice",
	"10": "The NCA forms a complicated threading pattern by first generating curved threads, snapping them to the diagonal and vertical directions, then joining them either over or under other threads.",
	"11_1": "NCA trained with the inception feature visualisation loss, exhibiting a variety of behaviours, often forming different solitons, such as eye-like shapes, and producing consistent patterns, such as interlaced corals. The initial images obtained are reference images from OpenAI Microscope. Some NCA results demonstrate strong similarity with their image-space optimized counterparts, while others are very different.",
	"11_2": "See 11_1",
	"11_3": "See 11_1",
	"11_4": "See 11_1",
	"11_5": "See 11_1",
	"13_bubbly_0101": "NCA generated texture on a 128x128 grid, which is then expanded to 256x256. The NCA fill in the missing textureand proceeds to finds consistency with the existing cells.",
	"13_chequered_0121": "See 13_bubbly_0101.",
	"14": "Two instances of an NCA running in parallel, at different wall-clock speeds. Each operate on the left and right half of the space, respectively. The left NCA and right NCA can also access the left-most, and right-most column of cells, respectively of the opposite NCA. The right NCA is stochastically evaluated at a rate approximately e times the rate of the left NCA. The label denotes the current time step of each NCA at the time of the snapshot. Despite running asynchronously, the NCA effectively communicates between the two instances using these two columns of mutually accessible cells, and forms a completely consistent pattern."
